# ELK Stack on macOS

## Configuration and overall management of an ELK stack running on a MacBook Pro

This project aims at running a working [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/) stack fully customizable and configurable by the user. The entire service is configured on macOS Catalina, on a 16'' MacBookPro.

System metrics will be collected to a **logstash** server, and the parsed data will be sent to the elasticsearch server. 

Using Kibana UI, one can see the entire index pattern and create any queries on the collected data.

> *"ELK" is the acronym for three open source projects: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. Elasticsearch is a search and analytics engine. Logstash is a serverâ€‘side data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to a "stash" like Elasticsearch. Kibana lets users visualize data with charts and graphs in Elasticsearch.*

## Running environment

Elasticsearch will be installed on a MacBook Pro running macOS Catalina.
Configuration of the machine:

## Worklfow

**Main goal**: View the MacBook Pro's system metrics in realtime with Kibana. Data will be stored in a Elasticsearch index.
